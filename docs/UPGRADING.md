# Upgrade Guide

## General process

1. Back up `config/packages/nowo_workflow.yaml`
2. Read [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for breaking changes
3. Run `composer update nowo-tech/workflow-bundle`
4. Run `php bin/console nowo:workflow:sync-schema`
5. Clear cache: `php bin/console cache:clear`

## Upgrading to 1.4.2

From 1.4.1:

```bash
composer update nowo-tech/workflow-bundle
php bin/console cache:clear
```

No database migration, configuration change, or code update is required. This release only renames and refines maintainer CI documentation (`GITHUB_CI.md`); Symfony integrators are unaffected.

## Upgrading to 1.4.1

From 1.4.0:

```bash
composer update nowo-tech/workflow-bundle
php bin/console cache:clear
```

No database migration, configuration change, or code update is required. This release adds maintainer-only git hygiene tooling, Code of Conduct, and CI/documentation updates; Symfony integrators are unaffected.

## Upgrading to 1.4.0

From 1.3.x:

```bash
composer update nowo-tech/workflow-bundle
php bin/console cache:clear
```

No database migration, configuration change, or code update is required. This release adds maintainer-only Spec Kit scaffolding and baseline documentation; Symfony integrators are unaffected.

## Upgrading to 1.3.0

From 1.2.x:

```bash
composer update nowo-tech/workflow-bundle
php bin/console cache:clear
```

No database migration is required.

### Optional: role-based CRUD UI protection

If you use **Symfony Security**, you can alias the built-in checker instead of writing a custom class:

```yaml
# config/services/nowo_workflow_security.yaml
services:
    Nowo\WorkflowBundle\Contract\WorkflowUiAccessCheckerInterface:
        class: Nowo\WorkflowBundle\Service\RoleBasedWorkflowUiAccessChecker
        arguments:
            $requiredRoles: ['ROLE_ADMIN']
            $authorizationChecker: '@security.authorization_checker'
```

New Flex installs receive this file from the recipe (commented until `symfony/security-bundle` is installed). The `ui.required_roles` config key documents the intended roles but does **not** auto-register the checker — you must alias the service (or use `access_control`).

### Optional: enable new UI locales

Catalogs for `de`, `nl`, and `pt` ship with the bundle. Add them to `ui.locales` to show them in the locale switcher:

```yaml
nowo_workflow:
    ui:
        locales: [en, es, fr, it, de, nl, pt]
```

## Upgrading to 1.2.0

From 1.1.x:

```bash
composer update nowo-tech/workflow-bundle
php bin/console cache:clear
```

### Breaking: PHP and Symfony

| Requirement | 1.1.x | 1.2.0 |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| PHP | 8.1+ | **8.2+** |
| Symfony | 6.3, 7.x, 8.x | **7.x, 8.x only** |
| Symfony 8 + Doctrine | — | PHP **8.4+** and `doctrine/doctrine-bundle` **^3.2.4** |

If you run **Symfony 6.4** or **PHP 8.1**, stay on `1.1.x` until you upgrade the host application.

For **Symfony 8**, ensure the app uses `doctrine/doctrine-bundle` ^3.2.4 (requires PHP 8.4+). Symfony 7 apps can keep `doctrine-bundle` ^2.13.

## Upgrading to 1.1.0

From 1.0.x:

```bash
composer update nowo-tech/workflow-bundle
php bin/console nowo:workflow:sync-schema
php bin/console cache:clear
```

No database migration is required when keeping the default `table_prefix: workflow_` (same physical table names as 1.0.0).

### Optional: protect the CRUD UI

Register a custom `WorkflowUiAccessCheckerInterface` implementation. Without it, the UI remains open (same as 1.0.0). See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#protecting-the-crud-ui).

### Optional: custom table prefix

If you set `table_prefix` to a value other than `workflow_`, run `nowo:workflow:sync-schema` after changing config. Existing installations should keep the default unless you intentionally rename tables.

### Translation overrides

If you override bundle translations, ensure files are named `NowoWorkflowBundle.<locale>.yaml` (not `nowo_workflow.<locale>.yaml`). The translation domain is still **`NowoWorkflowBundle`**.

### Custom registry or tests

`WorkflowApplicator` now depends on `WorkflowRegistryInterface`. Custom implementations or test doubles should implement that interface; `DatabaseWorkflowRegistry` remains the default service.

## Upgrading to 1.0.0

Initial release. Install with:

```bash
composer require nowo-tech/workflow-bundle
```

Register routes and sync schema as described in [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

### Translation domain

UI translations use domain **`NowoWorkflowBundle`**. Override in `translations/NowoWorkflowBundle.<locale>.yaml`.

### Twig templates

Override under `templates/bundles/NowoWorkflowBundle/` (see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)).

## Compatibility

| Bundle | Symfony | PHP |
|--------|---------|-----|
| 1.x | 7.x (PHP 8.2+), 8.x (PHP 8.4+) | 8.2 – 8.5 |
